 how the system works:

A school has many students and teachers. It has also many courses(subjects) taught. A grade level can have many courses assigned. These courses in turn will be assigned to the students in that particular grade.
The levels of students are categorized into grades and sections. A student can be in Grade 5, but if grade 5 students are huge in number, they are divided into sections. eg: Grade 5 section A, Grade 5 section B.
Students are placed in unique classrooms. A classroom will be unique throughout. Classroom of Grade 5 Section A of year 2010 will be different from Classroom of Grade 5 Section A of year 2011.
Students are assigned parents. A parent can have more than one student in the school.
One or more classrooms can be assigned to a teacher.
Attendance for students are taken by their teacher on a daily basis
There will be many types of exams. Exam results are stored for each subject (course).
